                    Albert Einstein (born 14 March 1879) is a German-born theoretical physicist, 
                    widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time. 
                    Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, 
                    but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. 
                    Relativity and quantum mechanics are the two pillars of modern physics. 
                    His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, 
                    has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation". 
                    His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. 
                    He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, 
                    and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", 
                    a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. 
                    His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in "Einstein" becoming synonymous with "genius". 
                    Einsteinium, one of the synthetic elements in the periodic table, was named in his honor.
                    <br/>
                    In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle year'), Einstein published four 
                    groundbreaking papers. These outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, 
                    introduced special relativity, and demonstrated mass–energy equivalence. Einstein thought that the laws of 
                    classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field, which led him to 
                    develop his special theory of relativity. He then extended the theory to gravitational fields, 
                    he published a paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. In 1917, he applied 
                    the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe. He continued to deal with problems of 
                    statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of 
                    molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, which laid 
                    the foundation of the photon theory of light.

                        <h3>Theory of relativity</h3>
                        <img src="images/blog1.jpg" class="blog_img">
                        <p>In his early days in Berlin, Einstein postulated that the correct interpretation of 
                            the special theory of relativity must also furnish a theory of gravitation and on March 20, 1916 
                            ubmitted to the German scientific journal Annalen der Physik the final version of an article outlining 
                            his answer to the scientific problem he had been wrestling with for nearly a decade. He called his solution a 
                            “General Theory of Relativity” and included its applications to cosmology in the publication. 
                            A thorough introduction to tensor calculus and curved manifolds is included.  After the necessary 
                            mathematical tools are introduced, a thorough presentation of the theory of relativity is given. 
                            Anisotropic cosmological models are also included in it.

                        <h3>Investigations on Theory of Brownian Movement</h3>
                        <img src="images/blog2.jpg" class="blog_img">
                        <p>This volume contains five papers investigating the dynamics of this phenomenon by Albert Einstein. 
                            Written between 1905 and 1908, the papers evolve an elementary theory of the Brownian motion, 
                            of interest not only to mathematicians but also to chemists and physical chemists. The titles of 
                            the papers are "Movement of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Demanded by 
                            the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat", "On the Theory of the Brownian Movement", 
                            "A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions", "Theoretical Observations on the Brownian Motion", and 
                            "Elementary Theory of the Brownian Motion." The book was published in 1926.

                        <h3>The Evolution of Physics</h3>
                        <img src="images/blog3.jpg" class="blog_img">
                        <p>Published in 1938, the theoretical problems that physicists had to face throughout history and their 
                            solutions are explained in this book. It really puts the emphasis on the philosophical aspect of physics 
                            and the thought process that comes with it, without getting in too much to the technical part. 
                            Using this work to push his realist approach to physics in defiance of much of quantum mechanics, 
                            Einstein's The Evolution of Physics was published to great popularity and was featured in a Time 
                            magazine cover story.
